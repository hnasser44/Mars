                <h1>WHY <span>MARS?</span></h1>
                <p>At an average distance of 140 million miles, <span id="edit-span2">Mars</span> is one of Earth's closest habitable neighbors. <span id="edit-span2">Mars</span> is about half again as far from the Sun as Earth is, so it still has decent sunlight. It is a little cold, but we can warm it up. Its atmosphere is primarily CO2 with some nitrogen and argon and a few other trace elements, which means that we can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the atmosphere. Gravity on <span id="edit-span2">Mars</span> is about 38% of that of Earth, so you would be able to lift heavy things and bound around. Furthermore, the day is remarkably close to that of Earth</p>

                <h1><span>Mars</span> 2020 Perseverance Rover</h1>
                <p>
                    The <span>Mars</span> 2020 Perseverance Rover mission is part of NASA's <span>Mars</span> Exploration Program, a long-term effort of robotic exploration of the Red Planet. The mission addresses high-priority science goals for Mars exploration, including key questions about the potential for life on <span>Mars</span>. Perseverance takes the next step by not only seeking signs of habitable conditions on <span>Mars</span> in the ancient past, but also searching for signs of past microbial life itself. The rover introduces a drill that can collect core samples of the most promising rocks and soils and set them aside in a "cache" on the surface of <span>Mars</span>. A future mission could potentially return these samples to Earth. That would help scientists study the samples in laboratories with special room-sized equipment that would be too large to take to <span>Mars</span>. The mission also provides opportunities to gather knowledge and demonstrate technologies that address the challenges of future human expeditions to <span>Mars</span>. These include testing a method for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, identifying other resources (such as subsurface water), improving landing techniques, and characterizing weather, dust, and other potential environmental conditions that could affect future astronauts living and working on <span>Mars</span>. Perseverance was timed for a launch opportunity between July 30 and Aug. 15, 2020, when Earth and <span>Mars</span> were in good positions relative to each other for landing on <span>Mars</span>. That is, it took less power to travel to Mars at that time, compared to other times when Earth and Mars are in different positions in their orbits. To keep mission costs and risks as low as possible, the <span>Mars</span> 2020 design is based on NASA's successful <span>Mars</span> Science Laboratory mission architecture, including its Curiosity rover and proven landing system</p>
